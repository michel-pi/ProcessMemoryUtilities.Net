            Allocates memory charges (from the overall size of memory and the paging files on disk) for the specified reserved memory pages. The
            function also guarantees that when the caller later initially accesses the memory, the contents will be zero. Actual physical pages are not
            allocated unless/until the virtual addresses are actually accessed. To reserve and commit pages in one step, call VirtualAllocEx with
            MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE. Attempting to commit a specific address range by specifying MEM_COMMIT without MEM_RESERVE and a non-NULL
            lpAddress fails unless the entire range has already been reserved. The resulting error code is ERROR_INVALID_ADDRESS. An attempt to commit
            a page that is already committed does not cause the function to fail. This means that you can commit pages without first determining the
            current commitment state of each page. If lpAddress specifies an address within an enclave, flAllocationType must be MEM_COMMIT.

            Reserves a range of the process's virtual address space without allocating any actual physical storage in memory or in the paging file on
            disk. You commit reserved pages by calling VirtualAllocEx again with MEM_COMMIT. To reserve and commit pages in one step, call
            VirtualAllocEx with MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE. Other memory allocation functions, such as malloc and LocalAlloc, cannot use reserved memory
            until it has been released.

            Indicates that data in the memory range specified by lpAddress and dwSize is no longer of interest. The pages should not be read from or
            written to the paging file. However, the memory block will be used again later, so it should not be decommitted. This value cannot be used
            with any other value. Using this value does not guarantee that the range operated on with MEM_RESET will contain zeros. If you want the
            range to contain zeros, decommit the memory and then recommit it. When you use MEM_RESET, the VirtualAllocEx function ignores the value of
            fProtect. However, you must still set fProtect to a valid protection value, such as PAGE_NOACCESS. VirtualAllocEx returns an error if you
            use MEM_RESET and the range of memory is mapped to a file. A shared view is only acceptable if it is mapped to a paging file.

            To retrieve the addresses of the pages that have been written to since the region was allocated or the write-tracking state was reset, call
            the GetWriteWatch function. To reset the write-tracking state, call GetWriteWatch or ResetWriteWatch. The write-tracking feature remains
            enabled for the memory region until the region is freed.

            MEM_RESET_UNDO should only be called on an address range to which MEM_RESET was successfully applied earlier. It indicates that the data in
            the specified memory range specified by lpAddress and dwSize is of interest to the caller and attempts to reverse the effects of MEM_RESET.
            If the function succeeds, that means all data in the specified address range is intact. If the function fails, at least some of the data in
            the address range has been replaced with zeroes. This value cannot be used with any other value. If MEM_RESET_UNDO is called on an address
            range which was not MEM_RESET earlier, the behavior is undefined. When you specify MEM_RESET, the VirtualAllocEx function ignores the value
            of flProtect. However, you must still set flProtect to a valid protection value, such as PAGE_NOACCESS. Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7,
            Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP: The MEM_RESET_UNDO flag is not supported until Windows 8 and

            point to the base address returned by the VirtualAllocEx function when the region is reserved. The function fails if either of these
            conditions is not met. If any pages in the region are committed currently, the function first decommits, and then releases them. The
            function does not fail if you attempt to release pages that are in different states, some reserved and some committed. This means that you
            can release a range of pages without first determining the current commitment state. Do not use this value with MEM_DECOMMIT.

            Pages in the region become guard pages. Any attempt to access a guard page causes the system to raise a STATUS_GUARD_PAGE_VIOLATION

            Pages. When an access attempt leads the system to turn off guard page status, the underlying page protection takes over. If a guard page
