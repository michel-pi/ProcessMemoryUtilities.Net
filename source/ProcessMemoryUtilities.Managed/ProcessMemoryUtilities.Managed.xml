If you are reserving memory, the function rounds this address down to the nearest multiple of the allocation granularity. If you are committing memory that is already reserved, the function rounds this address down to the nearest page boundary.To determine the size of a page and the allocation granularity on the host computer, use the GetSystemInfo function. If lpAddress is NULL, the function determines where to allocate the region. If this address is within an enclave that you have not initialized by calling InitializeEnclave, VirtualAllocEx allocates a page of zeros for the enclave at that address.The page must be previously uncommitted, and will not be measured with the EEXTEND instruction of the Intel Software Guard Extensions programming model. If the address in within an enclave that you initialized, then the allocation operation fails with the ERROR_INVALID_ADDRESS error.</param>

If lpAddress is not NULL, the function allocates all pages that contain one or more bytes in the range from lpAddress to lpAddress+dwSize.This means, for example, that a 2-byte range that straddles a page boundary causes the function to allocate both pages.</param>
